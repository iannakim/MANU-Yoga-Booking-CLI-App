## Inspiration Behind Mānu
This project was inspired by my cohort, Hortencia Cisneros and my love of yoga and mindful movements that brings happiness to people. Despite the extraordinary times that we are living in currently because of Covid-19, New Yorkers have continued to pursue wellness of their mind and body and we hope that will never change.
